Notes

For speed of development + time constraints, 

	this application was developed with a single service architecture and no security features
	like Basic Authentication:: username/password
	
	With more time and investment, this could be broken down into a micro-services architecture 
	that would communicate through seperately deployed message brokers as well as RESTful 
	communication with the use of circuit breakers. The services may include some of the following:

    API Gateway for allowing public facing access to an API.
    Authentication service for ensuring the authorization of users
    The ForeignExchange service to maintain current prices and send out onto stream
    An in-memory cluster/Redis that each cluster would process incoming trades for a set of userId's
    Statistics service that would process UI requests for statistics.
	Active MQ can be replaced with Azure Queue service.

	Also, one current test exists to ensure the application context can be loaded and the application can serve requests.
	BDD tests could be incorporated in to allowed for comprehensible test scenarios.
